A challenge is to remove the need for a person ever to have to 
think up a file name.

BERNERS-LEE ON THE WEB
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is gratified that people find the
Web useful, but disappointed that for most people, the Web is a browsing
activity rather than a creative one.  He'd like to see Web technology speed
up, and the computers used to access it made easier to use.  "The Web has
many ways to grow.  It is acquiring richness in interface, with 3-D and
real-time audio and video.  I hope that we can finish the process of hiding
the computers and the Net.  A challenge is to remove the need for a person
ever to have to think up a file name."  (Investor's Business Daily 7 Jun 96 A1)

Emperor Meiji's 'Charter Oath', April 1868:
 
'Knowledge shall be sought for all over the world and thus shall be
strengthened the imperial polity'.

John Tzetzes (c. 1110-1180) ... His range was immense ... He had
a phenomenal memory ... philological commentaries on works of 
classical Greek poetry ... works of scholarship in verse ... long,
allegorical commentaries ... encyclopedia of Greek mythology ...
long hexameter poems ... works of popularization ...
Tzetzes compiled a collection of his letters, as did many of his 
contemporaries.  He then went on, however, and equipped it with a 
gigantic commentary in nearly 13,000 lines of 'political' verse,
which is a veritable encyclopedia of miscellaneous knowledge.  
Later he went on to add the elements of a prose commentary on his
commentary.  The whole work conveys an impression of scholarship
without an object, of a powerful engine driving nothing.  Tzetzes
was in some ways a misfit and a failure in his own society.  Yet 
his devotion of immense energy and erudition to a trivial end is
a feature found elsewhere in the literature of the twelfth century,
and points to a breakdown in the structure of Byzantine society and
Byzantine life, a growing discrepancy between ends and means.

Maybe the search for the next great compelling application is 
really the search for human identity.

"The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always 
struck me as rather silly.  I would rather use them to mimic something
better".

Virtually every current UI (user interface) is more or less a clone 
of the Macintosh UI from 1984.  

Web browsers are applications in the style of the currently dominant
UI paradigm, so they are inherently ill suited for the task of 
browsing the Web.  

... cannot represent every signle Web object in a navigation UI ... 
methods to reduce the clutter...
Aggregation ...
Summarization ...
Filtering ...
Elision ...

The traditional information retrieval concepts of precision and recall
are not well suited for the Web becasue they implicitly assume that
users want a complete set of relevant documents.  On the Web, nobody
will ever have the time to read all the relevant documents, and it is
more important to guide the user to a small number of high-quality
documents than to achieve completeness.


From J. Nielsen, "User interface directions for the Web", CACM, Jan.
1999, 42, 65-72.
