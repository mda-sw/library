To install, source the file

  install.q

in S-Plus.  Check it out first - it sources script files, and dynamically
loads object files.  In particular, check to see if the placement of help
files is acceptable.  Note also that in a few places in the S script files,
it is assumed that motif is the window management system in use: you may 
need to change this to an alternative windowing system.

Help files are available for functions: bea, distance, hierclust, members,
modclust, partition, pca, plot.clustering, print.clustering, 
summary.clustering, plot.hierarchy, print.hierarchy, summary.hierarchy,
ca, ca.supplr, ca.supplc, flou, logique, sammon.
