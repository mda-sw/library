(1) LDA (linear discriminant analysis).
    At approx. line 108, ensure that the absolute value of the determinant is
    checked out:
    IF (ABS(D).GT.0.00001) GOTO 1150
    In early versions of this program, the actual value of D was checked 
    against an epsilon, leading to many cases of termination with a seeming
    indication of singularity.
(2) PCA (principal components analysis).
    In the routine which outputs eigenvalues in PCA (called OUTEVL in earlier
    versions, but because of potential subroutine-name conflicts, this name
    was changed in later versions), about 10 lines from the end, delete:
    VALS(K) = VCPC
    The comments at the beginning of the program should now be updated to 
    indicate that W1, on output, contains the eigenvalues (and not the 
    cumulative percentage variances associated with the principal components,
    as heretofore).  The effect of leaving in the above line was to overwrite
    information which is needed subsequently in the program.
(3) SEECL (hierarchical clustering utility routine).
    At very end, interchange I and J so that the loop statements read:
    DO 705 J=1,9
       DO 703 I=1,9
    Hence, J should be the outermost loop, and I the innermost one.  The 
    contraty situation lead to problems in certain situations.
(4) Write statements under Sun/Unix.
    There may be a need to alter the format Hollerith string, 1H , or 1H0, 
    to a preceding write statement (which outputs a blank character string).
(5) Precision of output values, emitted from write statements.
    Especially when using covariances or sums-of-squares-and-cross-products,
    the values obtained can in many instances be quite large.  These large
    values are badly handled by current write statements, and may give rise
    to frequent asterisks (indicating output unit space overflow).
(6) The following problem relates to incorrect loop handling.
    I have no problems in using these routines on VAX/VMS and Sun/Unix 
    machines; in some measure they have also been checked out on MS-DOS and
    VM/CMS machines.  However, compiling under VMS with use of the /CHECK=
    (BOUNDS) may yield a little can of worms... Here are some changes which
    are necessary to avoid having the compiler look after incorrect 
    out-of-bounds situations:
    (2.1) Insert the following statement before approx. line 25 of AGGLOM
          (i.e. before statement: "120 IF (D.GE.CRIT(I)) GOTO 140"):
          IF (I.EQ.0) GOTO 140
    (2.2) In approx. line 98 of HCON2, alter the line: "IDUM=ICHAIN(LEN+1)" 
          to: IF (LEN.LT.N) IDUM=ICHAIN(LEN+1)
    (2.3) Before approx. line 48 of HCASS (i.e. just after the "56 CONTINUE" 
          statement), insert the statement:
          IF (LOC.GT.LEV) GOTO 58
    There may well be other inaccuracies in beginning and terminating loops.


(7) MDA is sensitive to the values of the data: cf. scaling-up 
which is hard-wired in mda.f
