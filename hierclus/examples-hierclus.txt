==========================================================================

Examples of use of hierarchical clustering in native R (S-Plus) 
code, and in C callable from R.

Programs and scripts here:
hcluswtd.r
hierclustx.c
hierclustx.dll
hcluswtd_c.r

Report problems and issues to: Fionn Murtagh, f.murtagh at qub.ac.uk

Notes: 
1) Minimum variance (Ward's) agglomerative criterion used.  
2) Reciprocal nearest neighbours algorithm.
3) Weights or masses are used for the observations (cases, rows).
4) Versions are available in R (or S-Plus), that is slow for 
   anything other than very small data sets; and in C callable
   from an R program, for larger data sets.

==========================================================================

Running the full R (S-Plus) version, where all functions are 
contained in hcluswtd.r

source("c:/hcluswtd.r")
# Use 150 x 4 Fisher iris data as an example.
data(iris)
x <- iris[,1:4]
# Use equal weights, 1/n for each observation.
xh <- hierclust(x, rep(1/150, 150) )
names(xh)
# That takes a few minutes on my pretty reasonable desktop PC.

Same thing in S-Plus.
source("hcluswtd.r")
x <- rbind( iris[,,1], iris[,,2], iris[,,3] )
xh2 <- hierclust(x, rep(1/150, 150))
# That actually gave memory problems because of the 150x150 
# dissimilarity array used.

==========================================================================

# Use the C program instead.  The C source code is in 
# hierclustx.c, and the R driver program is in hcluswtd_c.r

# For Intel/Windows the object library is in: hierclustx.dll   
# For Unix systems, do: gcc -c hierclustx.c 
# or otherwise produce the object code, hierclustx.o

# Load this, in Intel/Windows:
dyn.load("c:/hierclustx.dll")
# Ignore the warning message ("DLL attempted to change...").
# Source the R driver:
source("c:/hcluswtd_c.r")
# Again use iris data, with identical weights.
data(iris)
x <- iris[,1:4]
# Here we have to coerce to matrix data type.  Compared to above, 
# following is more or less blindingly fast. 
xh3 <- HierClust(as.matrix(x), rep(1/150, 150) )
names(xh2) 


In the S-Plus dialect, on a Unix/Solaris machine, do the same.
gcc -c hierclustx.c

# Then in S-Plus:
source("hcluswtd_c.r")
dyn.open("hierclustx.o")
x <- rbind( iris[,,1], iris[,,2], iris[,,3] )
xh4 <- HierClust(x, rep(1/150, 150))

NOTES
=====

Note on plotting the dendrograms.
=================================

On both R/Intel/Windows and S-Plus/Sparc/Solaris, we found the 
output of the callable C code to be plottable with plclust.  

For R/Intel/Windows, we found the output of the stand-alone R 
program not to be plottable with plclust.  Instead, we used:
plot(as.dendrogram(xh)) 
For S-Plus/Sparc/Solaris, we also found the stand-alone S-Plus
program to have problems with plclust.  This was due to the 
presence in the returned list of list members like "call".  


Note on compiling on Unix systems.
==================================

Although we used simple gcc -c on a Sparc/Solaris system, 
another user had to do the following:
gcc -c hierclustx.c
gcc -shared -o hierclustx.so hierclustx.o
